Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(Not to be confused with a WordPress framework – [Redux Framework](https://redux.io))

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

You can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.
